# pyrosim: A python robot simulator. 

Pyrosim enables the creation of robots with arbitrary body plans
and neural controllers, and the optimization of them in arbitrary simulated
environments. [Read the Docs](https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim)

## Installation instructions.

  Download or clone the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ccappelle/pyrosim).

  If you downloaded the zipped version, unzip the directory somewhere you can access it.

  Note: Pyrosim has been tested on Python 2.7 and 3.6 but should work with any 3.x version of Python. 
  Pyrosim also currently only supports Linux and Mac OS. Windows support has been discontinued
  for the time being.

  This is the new version of pyrosim. For those looking for the old version it can be found
  [here](https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim).

### For Mac and Linux users:

  Open a terminal window, and navigate into that directory. For example:

  ```bash
  $ cd ~/Desktop/pyrosim
  ```
  If you are installing from Linux make sure you have build-essential and
  freeglut3 installed 

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
  $ sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
  ```

  To build the underlying physics engine, ODE, run
  build.sh:

  ```bash
  $ sh build.sh
  ```

  This takes three to five minutes. The output should look like this:
  
  ```bash
  Unpacking ode-0.12.tar.bz2...done
  Building ode-0.12...done
  Building simulator...done
  ```

  This installs ODE and compiles the local C++ code on your machine in the 
  pyrosim/simulator directory. 

  You can now use the package locally or install it using pip
  ```bash
  $ pip install -e .
  ```

  After installation you can test the package by changing to the Demos directory and running
  any one of the provided demos. 
  For example to play the first demo run
  ```bash
  $ python Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py 
  ```
  This should bring up an OpenGL window displaying an empty, virtual world.
  The window will close on its own after a few seconds.


### Notes
  
  If you already have pyrosim installed and want the latest update from the repository,
  change into the modules root directory (contains setup.py) and pull 
  ```bash
  $ git pull
  ```
  The C++ code is likely to have changed so  you have to recompile it by going int the simulator directory and typing make
  ```bash
  $ cd pyrosim/simulator
  $ make
  ```
  The simulator directory contains all of the C++ code used in pyrosim.
